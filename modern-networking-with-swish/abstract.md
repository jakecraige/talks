# Abstract

In the Apple ecosystem, everyone has their own way of implementing a network
stack. Many end up with a large `WebService` class where everything gets dumped.
These classes, like massive view controllers, expose broad interfaces that are
hard to understand, unwieldy to use, and difficult to test.

But network stacks don't have to be like this! Let's talk about how you can use
the Swish framework to build a protocol-oriented and testable networking stack
in Swift that will make you happy.
